# bids-app-template
A Template for Gears running on BIDS formatted data.

This template has a complete set of features to help convert
[BIDS Apps](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/about/) into
[Flywheel Gears](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec).

To create a new BIDS App gear using this template click on "Use
this template" above and then edit `run.py`, `manifest.json`,
`Dockerfile` and other files as necessary to create your gear.  Most
of the changes you need to make are at the beginning of `run.py` and
`Dockerfile` (search for "editme").  Python modules in `utils/`
provide features to help set up the data to run on, call the BIDS
App command, and then get the results into the output folder.  This
template was created specifically for gears that run on BIDS formatted
data, but it can be a good start to any gear.  The file `manifest.json`
provides examples of inputs, configuration parameters, and references.
After running the tests (which builds the Docker container), this
template can be uploaded as is with `fw gear upload` and will run
as a gear.

Change the version number in the manifest (in all three places) to be:

    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH_MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Where the first MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH refers to the _gear_ version and the
second MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH refers to the _algorithm_ that the gear runs.

Run the tests from the top level directory with:

```bash
./tests/bin/docker-test.sh
```

That will build the main docker image and a test image and then run
the tests inside the docker container.  Provide the flag "-B" to
prevent building the docker images and the "-s" flag to drop into
a shell inside the docker container instead of running the tests.
Once inside the container use this command to run the tests:

```bash
/src/tests/bin/tests.sh
```

The top level directory is mounted at `/src` so you can edit `run.py`, the modules in
`utils/`, and the tests in `tests/` and then use the above command to make sure it works.

To run a specific test provide `-- -k <testname>`:

```bash
/src/tests/bin/tests.sh -- -k wet_run_errors
```

Testing consists of unit tests and integration tests.  The integration tests mimic a gear
running on a Flywheel instance by providing files and directories that will be unzipped
inside the running docker container.  Here is the "dry_run" test:

```bash
    dry_run
    ├── config.json
    ├── input
    │   └── bidsignore
    │       └── bidsignore
    ├── output
    └── work
        └── bids
            ├── dataset_description.json
            └── sub-TOME3024
                └── ses-Session2
                    └── anat
                        ├── sub-TOME3024_ses-Session2_acq-MPR_T1w.json
                        └── sub-TOME3024_ses-Session2_acq-MPR_T1w.nii.gz
```

If you are logged in to a Flywheel instance on your local machine,
these integration tests can make SDK calls on that instance using
your api-key.

In the dry_run test shown above, BIDS formatted data is included
in the test so it does not need to be downloaded.  This gear won't
download data if `work/bids/` exists which saves a lot of time when
developing a BIDS App gear.  The "wet_run" test does download data
following a particular job id found in `config.json` just as the
job running on that platform would.  To make this test work for
you, change the "destination" ID in `config.json` to be the ID of
a valid Analysis container on your Flywheel instance.  Data will
be downloaded depending on the level where that analysis container
is attached (session, subject, or project).

The data for integration tests are stored in zip archives in
`tests/data/gear_tests`.  When creating or editing these integration
tests, the archives need to be unzipped.  When running the tests,
only the zipped files are used.  "Pack" and "unpack" commands are
provided in `tests/bin/` to create the zipped test files and to
allow editing of their contents.  From inside the `gear_tests`
directory, they can be run like this:

```bash
../../bin/pack-gear-tests.py all
../../bin/unpack-gear-tests.py dry_run.zip
```

Using the keyword "all", the first command zips all of the *.zip
files in that directory and the second command above unzips the
"dry_run" test.

It is also important to put the appropriate information in the
README.md file.  The following is an example of that.

## Overview
This gear can only be run on datasets that have been BIDS curated
and can pass the tests of the [BIDS
Validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator).
BIDS curation can be done before uploading data to the Flywheel
platform, or DICOM files can be uploaded and BIDS curation can be
done on the platform (see Setup below).

This Gear requires a (free) Freesurfer license. The license can be
provided to the Gear in 3 ways. See [How to include a Freesurfer
license file](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360013235453).

This gear can run at the project, subject or session
level.  Because files are in the BIDS format, all of the proper
files will be used for the given session, subject, or separately,
by subject, for the whole project.

## Setup: BIDS Curation
Before running BIDS curation on your data, you must first prepare
your data with the following steps:

1. Run the [SciTran: DICOM MR
Classifier](https://github.com/scitran-apps/dicom-mr-classifier)
gear on all the acquisitions in your dataset.  This step extracts
the DICOM header info, and store it as Flywheel Metadata.

1. Run the [DCM2NIIX: dcm2nii DICOM to NIfTI
converter](https://github.com/scitran-apps/dcm2niix) gear on all
the acquisitions in your dataset.  This step generates the Nifti
files that this gear needs from the DICOMS.  It also copies all
flywheel metadata from the DICOM to the Nifti file (In this case,
all the DICOM header information we extracted in step 1).

1. Run the [curate-bids gear](https://github.com/flywheel-apps/curate-bids)
on the project.  More information about BIDS Curation on Flywheel
can be found
[here](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008162154-BIDS-Overview)
and running the BIDS curation gear is described
[here](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360009218434-BIDS-Curation-Gear).
If you need to rename sessions or subjects before curation, you may
find the gear helpful:
[bids-pre-curate](https://github.com/flywheel-apps/bids-pre-curate).

1. Run the gear on a session, subject, or project.

Steps 1 and 2 can be automatically carried out as [gear
rules](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008553133-Project-Gear-Rules).

These steps MUST be done in this order.  Nifti file headers have
significantly fewer fields than the DICOM headers.  File metadata
will be written to .json sidecars when the files are exported in
the BIDS format as expected by the BIDS App which is run by this gear.

## Running:
To run the gear, select a
[project](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360017808354-EM-6-1-x-Release-Notes),
[subject](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360038261213-Run-an-analysis-gear-on-a-subject)
or
[session](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015505453-Analysis-Gears).

Instead of running at the project level which will sequentially
step through each subject, you can launch multiple jobs on subjects
or sessions in parallel.  An example of running the gear on a subject
using the Flywheel SDK is in this [notebook](notebooks/run-gear.ipynb).
More details about running gears using the SDK can be found in this
[tutorial](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/public/flywheel-tutorials/-/blob/ad392d26131ef22408423b5a5c14104253d53cd6/python/batch-run-gears.ipynb).

# Inputs
### bidsignore (optional)
A list of patterns (like .gitignore syntax) defining files that should be ignored by the
bids validator.

### freesurfer_license (optional)
Your FreeSurfer license file. [Obtaining a license is free](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html).
This file will be copied into the $FSHOME directory.  There are [three ways](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360013235453-How-to-include-a-Freesurfer-license-file-in-order-to-run-the-fMRIPrep-gear-)
to provide the license to this gear.  A license is required for this gear to run.

# Run Level

# Workflow/not passed to the fMRIPrep
This gear runs a short bash script that helps test the functionality of this
bids-app-template.

# Outputs
This gear produces some silly output that is not important just to
prove that it can.  It also adds some Custom Information to various
containers depending on the run level.
